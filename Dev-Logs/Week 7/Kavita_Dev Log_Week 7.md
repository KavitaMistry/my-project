The digital adventure I am hoping to go on is a little complicated and has definitely has set off on a slow foot. My goals are to use images of local historic buildings in Ottawa and retake the image from the same angle and point of view to show the transformation of then and now. I would then take these images and input them into a location based AR and use it as a tour of historic buildings in Ottawa, or something of that sort. 

My inspiration comes from working with a 3D rendering I have done for my workplace, where the goal is to put the technology in peoples hands and let them explore the history on their own terms.

As I said, this project is going a lot slower than I had wanted, but for now what I have done is searched for historic images of buildings in downtown Ottawa using the LAC website, and retrieving a few images of interest. I have been working through the basic web-based AR/VR tutorial on the 5706 course page. I have started with creating my own model, which did not turn out incredibly well but I am going to continue working on the tutorial. I will be away from Ottawa for a week and a bit so my now photography will have to wait. I am going to see if I can start the project without having to do the now photography just yet. 

I have been looking at HistoryPin to see how I can make this project a success in a different way if the AR does not work out for me. This website will allow me to pin where teh historic images are in the real world and give a sort of tour using their locations.

Unfortunately, it is not a big update but I hope to have something more to actually look at in my next Dev Log.
